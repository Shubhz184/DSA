# DSA-III-Sem
All VTU programs for III-Sem DSA

1.
  (a) Write a program to accept 3 integers and find the maximum among 3 numbers using 
  functions and pointers. 
  (b) Write a C program using pointer for searching the desired element from the array 
  using pointers. 
  (c) Write a program to find the maximum element in each row of the matrix using 
  pointers. 
2.  
  (a) Write a C program to read and display the Time in specified format. Create a 
   structure called TIME with hour (int), minute(int), second(int) and next(self- 
   referencing pointer ) as its members. Dynamically create two variables of structure 
   TIME and link the first variable to the second one and display it. Write a Display 
   function that takes address of first TIME variable and displays both times in the 
   format h:m:s. 
  (b) Write a C program to read and display the student details. Define a structure 
   'Student' with fields name(string) , usn(int), marks of 3 subjects (int) and 
   average(float) in it. Store the details of n students in an array of structure 'Student'. 
   Display the details of all students in the descending order their total marks. 
3.  
  (a) Write a C program using dynamic variables and pointers, to construct a singly linked 
  list. The operations to be supported are: 
    i) Insert at the front of a list. 
    ii) Insert at any position in the list. 
    iii) Deleting a node based on specified value. 
    iv) Searching a node based on specified value. 
    v) Displaying all the nodes in the list. 
  (b) Write a C program to reverse a linked list elements. 
4.  Write a C program to support the following operations on a doubly linked list where each 
  node consists of integers. 
  i) Create a doubly linked list by adding each node at the front. 
  ii)Insert a new node to the left of the node whose key value is read as an input. 
  iii) Delete the node of a given data, if it is found, otherwise display appropriate message. 
  iv) Display the contents of the list. 
5. Write a program to design, Develop and Implement a menu- driven program in C for the 
  following operations on STACK of integers (Array implementation of the stack with 
  maximum size MAX = 4). 
  i) Push an element on to stack. 
  ii) Pop an element from the stack. 
  iii) Check Overflow and Underflow situations on the stack. 
  iv) Display the contents of stack. 
  v) Exit. 
  Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations. 
6.
  a) Write a C program to convert an expression given in “infix” form to “postfix” form 
   using stack concept. 
  b) Check whether a given string is a palindrome or not by using a stack. 
  c) Write a program to find the nth term in the Fibonacci series using recursion. 
7. 
  a) Write a C program to simulate the working of a queues using an array provide and 
  implement the following operations: 
    i) Insert 
    ii) Delete 
    iii) Display 
    Assume that the size of the queue is 5. 
  b) Write a C program to implement a circular queue using linked lists. 
8. 
  a) Write a C program to construct a binary search tree of integers and also display the 
  elements in the tree using Inorder, Preorder and Postorder traversals. 
  b) Write a C program to find the number of leaf nodes in a BST 
  c) Write a C program to print all root to leaf paths of a BST. 
9.
  a) Write a C program to sort set of integers using radix sorting technique. 
  b) Write a C program to search using closed hashing.
